Problem Stateement
i)   At present, the child care institutions self report the number of children staying in their institution. 
     While the number of children is tracked, the identities are not captured, except for OAS (orphaned, 
	   abandoned and surrendered) children in the CARINGs website. 
ii)  The demand for funds is made by these CCIs under Integrated Child Protection Scheme. The release of funds 
	   is contingent on the number of children staying in these institutions and the number of staff in these 
	   institutions. This can lead to manipulation/wrong reporting of data by the CCIs. 
iii) The Child Welfare Committee is mandated under the Juvenile Justice Act for completing its proceedings in a 
     certain fixed time period. For instance except for OAS children, this time period is four months. For OAS 
	   children under two years of age, it is two months and for OAS children above two years of age, this is four
	   months. However it is seen that there are considerable delays in the completion of proceedings by the 
	   CWC.
